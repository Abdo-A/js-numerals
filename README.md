## Description

A project for converting numbers into words

It is built in vanila JS, as using React for such a small project would be much.

For example:
<pre>
7    == seven
42   == forty-two
2001 == two thousand and one
1999 == nineteen hundred and ninety-nine
17999 == seventeen thousand nine hundred and ninety-nine
</pre>
